Feel free to learn something or point and laugh at my code... and hate me for horrible commenting

## Actual description

This project (Useless Reptile) is All Rights Reserved. It means you can't just take it and use for whatever you want without my (Nord_Act aka NordAct) permission, especially assets.

You are allowed:
- Make monetized videos and streams with the mod 
- Use mod for modpacks
- Make submods, addons for the mod or any other project that relies on this mod and publish them, as long as this project is not a modified version of this mod
- Redistribute modified versions of assets within resource packs for this mod
- Partially use the code for your project from this one (by this I mean just don't rip off the
whole thing, at least mind what you copy)
- Make modified versions of the mod for **private use** (don't publicly distribute those)

This repository exists purely for visibility of the source code. Don't expect much action here.
Support for the mod is manually provided on mod's Discord server (link below). For general information about the mod head over to either Modrinth or Curseforge page (links below)
